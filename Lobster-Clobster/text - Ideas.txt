Tic Tac Toe

A way for multiple games to be played on multiple servers (A problem for much later)

Countdown

The large numbers are 25, 50, 75, 100
The small numbers are 1 - 10
There will be a minimum of 2 of the same type and a maximum of 4 of the same type
Only addition, subtraction, multiplication and division within whole numbers is allowed (0.3, 0.25, 0.3, 0.15 chances)
At least 1 addition and multiplication must occur, then additional operations will occur with a lower probability
    Continue rolling random numbers until you get one smaller than the last
    A maximum of 6 operations may occur
A timer of 30 seconds will be set
The closest number sent within those 30 seconds will be saved in an object with the users id, username and number
Ideally all calculations will be on paper and no calculators are allowed
Once the 30 seconds end, the player with the closest number will have to send their proof, ideally a photo and their victory will be confirmed
once a different player types confirm

PROBLEM WITH CHECKING THE EXISTENCE OF A WORD. PROBABLY EASY, BUT I CAN'T BE BOTHERED RIGHT NOW, SINCE I HAVE OTHER POSSIBILITIES.
NOTE TO SELF: JUST SEARCH IT UP AND ACCEPT THAT YOU'RE LAZY
The game will start by sending the letters in a code block
Then there will be a 35 second timer
All words containing the right letters that are sent within those 35 seconds will be saved under an object with user ID, word(or latest 9 letter word)  and (time or Number of 9 letter words)
There will be up to 5 objects saved. If there are more players, then only the players with the longest words will be saved


Pub quiz

Just a typical quiz using an array of questions, questions must not repeat themselves
Use a an object constructor to save players
Use a reaction voting system or just type into DMs?
